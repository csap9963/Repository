CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
======================

Continuous Integration makes it easier for developer groups to create  
their project. All members have at every time the posibility to reach  
the files of the other members.

Due the automated build problems can be dedected early.

All files are stored in one repository and reacheable for all developers.
