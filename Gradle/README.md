CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
======================

Continuous Integration makes it easier for developer groups to create  
their project. All members have the possibility to reach  
the files of the other members at every time.

Due the effect that the automated build problems can be dedected early,   
the developers can spend more time to program features instead of 
searching for bugs.

All files are stored in one repository and are reachable for all developers.

Advantages of CI:
	* Maintain a single source repository
	* Automate the build
	* Make your build self-testing
	* Every commit should build on an integration machine
	* Keep the build fast
	* Test in a clone of the production environment
	* Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable
	* Everyone can see whatâ€™s happening
	* Automate deployment
	
The developers have to check in frequently and are not allowed to 
upload broken code. All the code must be tested before being uploaded
